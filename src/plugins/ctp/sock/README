SOCK_DEFAULT_MSS
    The default Maximum Segment Size is the default amount of data that is sent
    in a message. This does not include the size of the header and should not
    big bigger than the maximum size of a UDP packet. A given communication
    pattern may require a small or big MSS to be efficient

SOCK_EP_RX_CNT
    Number of buffers used to receive messages. Directly impact the memory
    footprint of the CCI transport.

SOCK_EP_TX_CNT
    Number of buffers used to send messages. Directly impact the memory
    footprint of the CCI transport.

SOCK_PROG_TIME_US
    Specify the amount of time in microseconds to make progress (the thread
    will make up every N microseconds). A low progress timeout decrease the
    latency but increase the CPU consumption.

SOCK_RMA_DEPTH
    Number of in-flight RMA message.

ACK_TIMEOUT
    The transport can acknowledge messages by blocks. The ACK timeout is
    triggered when not enough ACKs are pending within a given period of
    time.

PENDING_ACK_THRESHOLD
    Maximum number of messages waiting for acknowledgment.
