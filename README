Thank you for using CCI.


= Supported Transports =========================================================

The following transports are supported (more coming soon):

  Sockets (UDP)
  OFA Verbs (InfiniBand and RoCE)
  Cray GNI (Gemini and Aries)
  Linux Ethernet (raw Ethernet)
  TCP
  Shared Memory


= Current Limitations ==========================================================

The current CCI prototype has the following limitations:

  Multicast connections are not implemented

  See README.<transport> for additional notes and limitations for that
  transport.

  The current CCI build system supports the standard 'make dist' command but
  users may face problems when using a MacOS/BSD environment, resulting in
  empty distribution archives. In this context, the following error message
  will appear in the output of the 'make dist' command:
    Numeric user ID too largeNumeric group ID too large
  This error is due to a user ID and group ID that BSD tar is trying to include
  into the archive but that cannot be encoded, usually because the user account
  is a "Network User" account. To address this problem, please follow these
  instructions:
    - compile GNU tar from source (http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/),
    - extend your PATH environment variable to include the directory where the
      GNU tar binary has been compiled,
    - set the TAR_OPTIONS environment variable to "--owner=0 --group=0
      --numeric-owner",
    - run the autogen.pl and configure commands again.
  You should then be able to successfully create the CCI distribution archive
  by running the 'make dist' command.
