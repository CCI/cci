== From a tarball (.tar.gz) ==

To install CCI from a tarball, simply execute the following commands:
- untar the file by running "tar xzf cci-0.1b1.tar.gz",
- execute "cd cci-0.1b1"
- execute "./autogen.pl"
- execute "./configure", for the list of available options, please executei
  "./configure --help"
- execute "make && make install"

From here CCI is installed on your system

== Configuration & Testing ==

The current version of CCI requires a configuration file. The configuration
file specifies the network interface to use, as well as CCI parameters.

The configuration file, based on a INI format, follows the following pattern:

[<config_name>]
driver = <cci_driver>
ip = <ip_to_use>
default = <0 or 1>

Where:
- <cci_driver> is the driver to use. The available drivers are: sock.
- <ip> is the IP associated to the network interface to use.
- default specifies if the configuration is the default one (1) or not (0).

For instance, the configuration file when using CCI over UDP and the loopback
interface will look like the following:

[lo]
driver = sock
ip = 127.0.0.1
default = 1

Once the configuration file in place, the environment must be updated to
specify its path:
export CCI_CONFIG=<path_to_my_cci_config_file>

It is then possible to run a simple pingpong to test the installation:
- execute "cd src/test"
- execute "make pingpong"
- launch the server side of the pingpong "./pingpong -s", the server will
  it URI (e.g., "ip://127.0.0.1:60160"), which is need to start the client
- launch the client side of the pingpong with a reliable ordered connection and
  no parameters for performance evaluation:
    "./pingpong -h <server_uri> -i 1 -W 1 -c ro"
  The client should give you an output similar to:

Using RO connection
Opened ip://127.0.0.1:65381
